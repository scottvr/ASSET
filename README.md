# [ASSET] Audio Separation Stemfile Enhancement Toolkit

# Important!
current status


While renaming the repo and doing some refactoring, I merged a documentation branch into main and pushed to github. The docs may make the project look more ready-for-primetime than it is. 

there is still quite a bit of code that is local to my machine only, including the training code, which like the rest of stemprover, is still under active development. 

I appreciate your interest and when this repo is usable, I will have detailed installation and usage instructions documented. Unfortunately, that time is not now.

# StemProver: Phase-Aware Audio Artifact Reduction via Controlled Latent Diffusion

## Overview

StemProver introduces a novel approach to source separation artifact reduction by leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of large-scale diffusion models, specifically focusing on the controlled manipulation of latent representations while preserving phase coherence across frequency bands.

## Technical Innovation

### Core Architecture
- Implements phase-aware latent diffusion architecture with LoRA-based fine-tuning for spectrogram manipulation
- Preserves complex phase relationships through custom loss functions targeting phase coherence
- Incorporates LoRA-based lightweight fine-tuning for minimal disruption to pretrained diffusion model weights
- Maintains frequency-dependent phase weighting based on perceptual importance

### Key Features
- Frequency-band specific artifact detection and reduction
- Modular enhancement pipeline supporting multiple specialized LoRA adaptations
- Complex-domain spectrogram processing with phase preservation
- Adaptive segmentation with overlap-add reconstruction

## Implementation Details

### Signal Processing
- Phase-aware STFT processing with configurable overlap
- Frequency-dependent phase coherence preservation
- Perceptually weighted reconstruction metrics
- Adaptive threshold determination for artifact detection

### Model Architecture
- Modified LoRA-based architecture with phase-aware zero convolutions
- Specialized preprocessors for artifact type detection
- Multiple LoRA adaptations for targeted artifact reduction
- Frequency-band specific attention mechanisms

### Training Strategy
- Binary pair training with direct before/after examples
- Progressive artifact targeting through specialized models
- Overlap-based segmentation for efficient training
- Validation through comprehensive spectral analysis

## Technical Advantages

### Over Traditional Methods
- Leverages semantic understanding from pretrained diffusion models
- Maintains phase coherence without explicit phase unwrapping
- Supports targeted artifact reduction without full separation
- Modular architecture allows incremental improvements

### Novel Contributions
- Phase-aware adaptation of LoRA-based architecture architecture
- Frequency-dependent phase processing pipeline
- Modular artifact-specific enhancement
- Complex-domain spectrogram manipulation while preserving phase relationships

## Performance Metrics

### Audio Quality
- Phase coherence preservation across frequency bands
- Frequency response maintenance in critical bands
- Signal-to-noise ratio improvements
- Perceptual quality metrics (PESQ, STOI)

### Computational Efficiency
- Memory-efficient processing through segmentation
- Optimized inference through cached zero convolutions
- Parallel processing capabilities for batch enhancement
- Configurable quality/speed tradeoffs

## Implementation Stack
- PyTorch for core model implementation
- Custom phase-aware layers for complex processing
- librosa/numpy for audio processing pipeline
- Comprehensive analysis tools for validation

## Future Directions
- Extension to multi-stem separation artifacts
- Investigation of cross-modal semantic understanding
- Exploration of adaptive segmentation strategies
- Integration with real-time processing pipelines

# StemProver: Making Music Clearer Through AI Innovation

## What Does It Do?

Imagine you have a recording of your favorite song, and you want to hear just the singer's voice, or just the guitar. Modern AI tools can do this "separation" - they can pull apart the different parts of a song. However, these tools often introduce unwanted noise and distortion, especially in the higher notes of voices and instruments.

StemProver fixes these distortions. It's like having a master sound engineer who can clean up and perfect these separated music tracks.

## Why Is This Important?

This technology has many uses:
- Musicians can study specific parts of songs more clearly
- Music teachers can isolate instruments for students
- DJs and producers can create better remixes
- Karaoke tracks can sound more professional
- Archivists can preserve and restore old recordings

## What Makes It Special?

The most innovative aspect of StemProver is how it solves this problem. Instead of building everything from scratch, it cleverly uses existing AI technology that was originally designed for images.

Here's the creative part: StemProver converts audio problems into image problems, solves them using powerful image AI (which companies have spent millions developing), and then converts the solution back to audio. It's like:
1. Taking a photo of a sound
2. Using advanced photo-editing AI to fix the problems
3. Turning the fixed photo back into sound

This approach is novel because:
- It leverages years of research and billions in investment in image AI
- It preserves important sound qualities that other methods lose
- It can be trained to fix specific types of problems very effectively
- It's modular - new improvements can be added without rebuilding everything

## The Technology (In Simple Terms)

Think of it like having a very skilled translator who can:
- Convert sound into a special kind of picture (called a spectrogram)
- Use cutting-edge AI photo editing (similar to what smartphone cameras use)
- Translate the fixed picture back into crystal-clear sound

The system is smart enough to keep all the subtle details that make music sound natural and professional.

## Impact

This project demonstrates how creative thinking in AI development can solve complex problems in new ways. Instead of competing with existing solutions, StemProver enhances them, making music separation technology more useful for everyone from professional musicians to casual listeners.
