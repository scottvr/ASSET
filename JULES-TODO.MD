Of course. Here is the action plan formatted as a markdown checklist. You can copy and paste this into a Gist, a TODO.md file in your repository, or any markdown editor to track your progress.

ASSET/StemProver: Project Realization Checklist
Phase 1: Solidify the Foundation (Code & Data)
The goal of this phase is to clean up the existing code, establish a stable data pipeline, and ensure everything is consistent and reproducible before building on top of it.

[x] Consolidate Utilities:

[x] Create a central stemprover.utils module.

[x] Move shared functions (spectrogram generation, audio I/O, etc.) from common/, analysis/, and data_generation/ into the new utils module to reduce code duplication.

[x] Standardize Data Structures:

[x] Perform a full-project audit to ensure consistent use of the core dataclasses: ProcessingConfig, SeparationResult, and AudioSegment.

[x] Refactor any scripts (battery_tests_20241209.py, BS-validator.py, etc.) that use raw dictionaries or tuples where these dataclasses should be used.

[x] Build a "Golden Dataset":

[x] Use the waveform-generator-config_prime3.py script to generate a small, controlled set of test audio files from example-config.json.

[x] This dataset should include a clean mix, all corresponding stems, and at least one variation.

[x] Commit this small dataset to your repository (or a designated storage location) so it can be used for automated testing.

[ ] Establish a Reproducible Environment:

[ ] Review and finalize the dependencies in pyproject.toml.

[ ] Create a fresh virtual environment.

[ ] Install dependencies only from the pyproject.toml file.

[ ] Confirm the environment is correct by successfully running the "Golden Dataset" generation script.

Phase 2: Build and Validate the Core Pipeline
This phase focuses on making your data processing and analysis workflow functional from end to end, proving that data can flow through the system as intended.

[ ] Make the Main Test Battery Runnable:

[ ] Refactor battery_tests_20241209.py to use the "Golden Dataset" as input.

[ ] Debug the SpleeterSeparator and SpectralAnalyzer classes until the script runs from start to finish without errors, generating separation and analysis outputs.

[ ] Implement the PhaseAnalyzer:

[ ] Create a new file stemprover/analysis/phase.py.

[ ] Define the PhaseAnalyzer class inside it, addressing the TODO in __init__.py.

[ ] Move phase-related functions like phase_coherence and phase_difference from common/math_utils.py into this new class as methods.

[ ] Conduct the Band-Split Validation:

[ ] Flesh out and debug either BS-validator.py or minimal-B.S.py to make it a runnable script.

[ ] Run the script on your "Golden Dataset" to compare the "musical" and "original" frequency band configurations.

[ ] Save the quantitative results (e.g., SDR, SIR metrics) to a results file. This provides the data to justify your choice of DEFAULT_FREQUENCY_BANDS.

Phase 3: Implement and Train the Enhancement Model
This is the core machine learning phase. The goal is to get a baseline version of your enhancement model trained to prove the concept.

[ ] Finalize the TrainingDataset Pipeline:

[ ] Connect TrainingSegmentGenerator to the TrainingDataset class.

[ ] Ensure you can initialize a PyTorch DataLoader that yields batches of paired (artifacted_spectrogram, clean_spectrogram) tensors.

[ ] Write a small test script to iterate through a few batches from the DataLoader to verify shapes and data types are correct.

[ ] Implement the Full Training Loop:

[ ] Complete the ControlNetTrainer class in enhancement/training.py.

[ ] Implement the main training loop logic: batch iteration, forward pass through PhaseAwareControlNet, loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimizer step.

[ ] Add basic logging (e.g., print loss every N steps) and checkpoint saving.

[ ] Implement the Loss Functions:

[ ] Create a stemprover/enhancement/losses.py file.

[ ] Implement at least two loss functions based on your notes in thoughts_on_loss.txt:

[ ] Reconstruction Loss: An L1Loss or MSELoss on the spectrogram magnitudes.

[ ] Phase Coherence Loss: A loss based on the cosine of the phase difference.

[ ] Combine them in your training loop using a weighted sum.

[ ] Train a Baseline Model:

[ ] Train the model on the "Golden Dataset" for enough epochs to see the loss consistently decrease.

[ ] The objective here is not a perfect model, but proof that the entire training pipeline is functional and the model is capable of learning.

[ ] Save the final model checkpoint.

Phase 4: Integration, Application, and Documentation
This final phase focuses on making the model usable and updating the project documentation to reflect reality.

[ ] Create a Simple Inference Script:

[ ] Write a new command-line script enhance.py.

[ ] This script should accept two arguments: --model_checkpoint and --input_audio.

[ ] It should load the trained model, process the input audio, and save the enhanced output to a new file (e.g., input_enhanced.wav).

[ ] Integrate Enhancement into the Main Pipeline:

[ ] Create a copy of your battery_tests_20241209.py script called full_pipeline_test.py.

[ ] Add a new step in this script that calls your enhancement model after separation.

[ ] The new flow should be: Separate -> Analyze (Before) -> Enhance -> Analyze (After).

[ ] This will allow you to quantitatively measure the improvement provided by your model using your SpectralAnalyzer metrics.

[ ] Update Your Documentation:

[ ] Rewrite the README.md: Update it to reflect the actually implemented architecture and workflow. Be honest about the current status and future plans.

[ ] Add Usage Instructions: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the environment, run the training, and use the enhance.py script.

[ ] Show Your Results: Add a "Results" section to the README.md. Include the "before" and "after" analysis metrics from your full_pipeline_test.py to showcase the model's effectiveness. Include the findings from your band-split validation.
