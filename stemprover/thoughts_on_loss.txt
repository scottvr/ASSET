Why Use Multiple Loss Functions?
Complementarity: Different loss functions focus on specific aspects of the task, such as:
Amplitude accuracy.
Phase coherence.
Perceptual quality of reconstructed audio.
Trade-offs: A single loss function may overemphasize one metric (e.g., pixel-level similarity) at the cost of others (e.g., perceptual fidelity). Combining losses balances these objectives.
Proposed Loss Functions for Your Project
Below are categories of loss functions that align with your goals of spectrogram restoration and phase preservation:

1. Reconstruction Loss
Focuses on accurately reconstructing the spectrogram and preserving low-level details.
---
Mean Squared Error (MSE):
Measures pixel-wise differences between the reconstructed and clean spectrograms.
Why Include: Baseline loss to ensure overall similarity between the artifacted and clean spectrograms.

---
Logarithmic Spectrogram Loss:
Focuses on the logarithmic magnitude of spectrograms to emphasize perceptual differences.
Why Include: Human hearing is logarithmic, so this loss better aligns with perceptual differences.

2. Phase Coherence Loss
Ensures the reconstructed spectrogram maintains phase integrity.
---
Complex STFT Loss:
Computes the difference between the complex-valued STFT of the clean and reconstructed audio.
Why Include: Directly penalizes discrepancies in both amplitude and phase in the time-frequency domain.
---
Phase Consistency Loss:
Encourages alignment of the phase component between the clean and reconstructed spectrograms.
Why Include: Ensures phase coherence, crucial for perceptually accurate audio reconstruction.
---
3. Perceptual Audio Loss
Ensures that the restored audio sounds good to human ears, even if spectrogram-level differences exist.
---
PESQ Loss (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality):
Measures the perceptual quality of the reconstructed audio compared to the clean audio.
Why Include: Directly reflects human audio perception, ensuring high-quality output.
Loudness-Weighted Loss:
Emphasizes reconstruction accuracy for louder (more perceptually prominent) frequencies.
Why Include: Humans are more sensitive to errors in louder audio components.

4. Perceptual Embedding Loss
Uses embeddings from a pretrained audio model to measure perceptual similarity.
---
Audio Embedding Loss:
Compare embeddings of clean and reconstructed audio from a pretrained audio model (e.g., OpenL3 or PANNs).
Why Include: Focuses on high-level perceptual features, such as timbre and tonal quality.
5. Adversarial Loss (Optional)
Introduces a GAN-like discriminator to encourage realistic spectrogram outputs.
---
Discriminator Loss:
Train a discriminator to differentiate between clean and generated spectrograms.
The generator our model tries to "fool" the discriminator.
Why Include: Encourages the model to produce spectrograms indistinguishable from clean ones.
---

Combining Losses
Use a weighted sum of these loss functions to guide the model toward balanced improvements.
