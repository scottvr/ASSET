# StemProver: Phase-Aware Audio Artifact Reduction via Controlled Latent Diffusion

## Overview

StemProver introduces a novel approach to source separation artifact reduction by leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of large-scale diffusion models, specifically focusing on the controlled manipulation of latent representations while preserving phase coherence across frequency bands.

## Technical Innovation

### Core Architecture
- Implements phase-aware latent diffusion architecture with LoRA-based fine-tuning for spectrogram manipulation
- Preserves complex phase relationships through custom loss functions targeting phase coherence
- Incorporates LoRA-based lightweight fine-tuning for minimal disruption to pretrained diffusion model weights
- Maintains frequency-dependent phase weighting based on perceptual importance

### Key Features
- Frequency-band specific artifact detection and reduction
- Modular enhancement pipeline supporting multiple specialized LoRA adaptations
- Complex-domain spectrogram processing with phase preservation
- Adaptive segmentation with overlap-add reconstruction

## Implementation Details

### Signal Processing
- Phase-aware STFT processing with configurable overlap
- Frequency-dependent phase coherence preservation
- Perceptually weighted reconstruction metrics
- Adaptive threshold determination for artifact detection

### Model Architecture
- Modified LoRA-based architecture with phase-aware zero convolutions
- Specialized preprocessors for artifact type detection
- Multiple LoRA adaptations for targeted artifact reduction
- Frequency-band specific attention mechanisms

### Training Strategy
- Binary pair training with direct before/after examples
- Progressive artifact targeting through specialized models
- Overlap-based segmentation for efficient training
- Validation through comprehensive spectral analysis

## Technical Advantages

### Over Traditional Methods
- Leverages semantic understanding from pretrained diffusion models
